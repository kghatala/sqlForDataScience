# SQL for Data Science

To gain additional experience using various tools for large-scale data manipulation (and analysis), I've been working through the [Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation) course, offered on Coursera by the University of Washington. Part of this course deals with relational algebra and the manipulation of relational databases. This involved a series of exercises based around manipulating a term-document matrix (the reuters.db file) using a variety of SQL queries. The full description of the assignment can be found in the 'assignment2.html' file. In this repository are text files containing SQL queries that accomplish the tasks listed below:

- 'problem1a.txt' - the most basic select statement
- 'problem1b.txt' - a basic select project query
- 'problem1c.txt' - application of UNION
- 'problem1d.txt' - count unique documents that contain either of two specific terms
- 'problem1e.txt' - application of HAVING to find all large 300+ term documents
- 'problem1f.txt' - application of INTERSECT to find the number of unique documents containing both of two specific terms
- 'problem2.txt' - expression of matrix multiplication as a SQL query
- 'problem3a.txt' - use a SQL query to compute a document similarity matrix DD<sup>T</sup> from the term-document matrix D
- 'problem3b.txt' - perform a keyword search for 3 specific keywords, compute a document similarity matrix for the documents that contain those keywords
